## Games

### Trafic
Traffic was created in late 2010. With the release of XNA 4 and now being able to publish a game on Windows Phone 7 as well as Xbox 360 we find ourselves building another simple game to publish on both Xbox 360 and Windows Phone 7. The game consists of a player controlling traffic lights of a pre populated city to get the average commute time below the goal. This requires using the tools of a game to figure out bottle necks, open roads, and flow patterns. The game starts off with towns and ends in a metropolis.

### Fishbowl
Fishbowl was created in one week over my Christmas break in 2008. With the release of XNA networking and the 360 deployment system we were very interested in getting a simpler game together to publish. Fishbowl was born! based on a Nut Harvest a very addicting XNA game that was also very simple. The goal of this project was to figure out and test XNA networking. It was very interesting to deal with network prediction to get the game to work correctly. The game consists of a player controlling a fish to eat the most shrimp before the other fish. Look out for power ups and bombs! Fishbowl has accumulated over 20,000 trail downloads since January 2009. As well as covering the cost of the original assets.

### Camthalion of Andrill
Camthalion of Andrill was created in early 2005. It was created with RMXP an engine used by hobbits developers. I have created many RGSS scripts for the community over the years including the standard development kit (SDK) and my famed squad based action battle system (SBABS), but this is my first game created with this engine. The game consist of an RPG adventure to find a sword your father left in a temple when he was kill there. The sword belonged to the King and he asked you to return it to him. The game included many of my own scripts and was more of a test bed then a real game.
